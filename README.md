## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](C:\Users\Babalola Adebisi\Documents\wedwebclass\assets\css\style.css) - For styles

### What I learned

I figured more ways of how i could use the margin property and also the box-shadow property

### Continued development

I would like to get better with javascript and other languages (react) cause i fiigured out they are required to have a more functional page

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with my box-shadow property. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
